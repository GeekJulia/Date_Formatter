The Date object has a number of methods that allow you to get the date and time in different formats.

GetDate();
One of those is the .getDate() method, which returns a number between 1 and 31 that represents 
the day of the month for that date.

GetMonth();
The .getMonth() method returns a number between 0 and 11. This represents the month for the date provided, 
where 0 is January and 11 is December.

GetYear();
The .getFullYear() method returns a number which represents the year for the provided date.

GetHours();
The .getHours() method returns a number between 0 and 23. 
This represents the hour for the provided date, where 0 is midnight and 23 is 11 p.m.

GetMinutes();
The .getMinutes() method returns a number between 0 and 59 which represents the minutes for the provided date.

SWITCH
A switch statement is used to compare an expression against multiple possible values and 
execute different code blocks based on the match. It's commonly used for branching logic.

SPLIT()
The split() method is used to divide a string into substrings based on a specified separator. 
It then returns these substrings as elements of an array.
The split method takes in a parameter known as a separator. The separator is used to tell the computer where each split should occur.

To reverse an array of elements, you can use the reverse method. 
This method reverses the order of the elements in the array in place. 
The first element becomes the last, and the last element becomes the first.

JOIN()
Similar to the split method, the join method also takes an optional separator.
 If you don't provide a separator, the default separator is a comma.
